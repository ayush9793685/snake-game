# snake-game
this game is designed for practice.

to run the code you need to install pygame lib in your device.
to install pygame library
1- open cmd
2- type  (pip install pygame) in cmd .
once the pygame library is installed you have to set up a location for png's and change their location in the program in line 93 and 100.
after changing their location the program is ready to run.
this program could be more costumised by adding a snake body in it that can grow (work in progress).
